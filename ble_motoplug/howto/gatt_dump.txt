This howto explains how to dump the GATT table of a BLE device
using the cmd example script provided by Laird here:
https://github.com/LairdCP/RM1xx-Applications/blob/master/cmd.loramac.rm1xx.sb

# Do a scan
ble_scan start 5000 0

# Connect to a device
ble_connect 01FF6CFD93AEAE 5000 7500 100000 500000

# allocate gatt resources
gattc open 0 0

# interogate and dump the gatt table
gattc tablemap 1

As a side note, this is how to to walk te services
gattc svc first 1 0 0
gattc svc next 1
gattc svc next 1
gattc svc next 1

And this is how to walk the descriptors
gattc desc first 1 0 0
gattc desc next 1
gattc desc next 1
